# Portfolio

## What: 
    This is the fist step to creating my functional portfolio that I will use at a future time to show to employers what I can do with the skills I've Learned in this class. 

## Why:
    It is important that every developer has one central location where they store links to their work, like an electronic resume. Without this, future employers would not know what you are capable of. 

## How:
    Creating this site was a difficult task. I started off with creating all of the HTML for the index page, or About page. Once this was created, I added a bit of CSS to help with viewing the basic layout of what I was creating, then I used the same HTML as a backbone for my other pages. 

## Features:
    My page features links to my other pages, some great images of space, and some information about me.

## Difficulties:
    I had a lot of difficulties when creating this page. There was not one step that was easy, from getting the text to wrap around my profile image, to getting the background image to link, positioning my divs, and getting the images and divs on my profile page to line up, this whole website was a challenge. That being said, I am very proud of the final product.
