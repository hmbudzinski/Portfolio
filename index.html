            <p>My name is Hayley Budzinski. I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, and went to college at Colorado State University where I studied International Studies and International Development.</p>
            <p>After College, I traveled around Europe for eight months and worked in hostels and pubs. Following that trip, I went back to Alaska for six months and worked in a restaurant to save up some money before moving to Dublin, Ireland for a year.</p>
            <p>After living in Ireland, I moved to Denver and got a job as a Paralegal. Once I realized that being a paralegal was not what I wanted to do, I decided to take this course to change my life and become a coder!</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio!</p>
